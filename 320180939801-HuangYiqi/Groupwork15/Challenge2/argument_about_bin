I think it is better to choose the value of bin as 25. It is not difficult to find from the numerous histograms that when the bin value is relatively large, the histograms mostly present a two-peak state, which also means that the two-peak is likely to be an important feature of the time interval of Linux kernel code modification.
For large horizontal axis times, we can see that outliers are intermittent, which indicates that it is rare for a piece of code to take a long time to change in a stable Linux kernel.We can find that the overall trend of the image is right-skewed, which also indicates that the possibility of not modifying the adjustment for a long time is very small.
If we select a small value of bin, we can see some clues from the overview. Because the value of bin is too small, a lot of data are concentrated in a column, and the image also becomes a single peak, which may cause some data features cannot be displayed in the histogram.
